# Preprocessing of data used to fit surrogate models

Note, that code included in this folder is not used for reproducibility of the results stated in the paper but instead perserved here in order to allow for full transparency
and reproducibility of fitted surrogates. As a result, code contained in this folder is not fully commented.
Raw and pre-processed data can be obtained on requuest from paper authors due to considerable file sizes (e.g. the raw xgboost data has around 36 GB).
